# odin-recipes
A delightfully brutal recipe blog

In this project I will be creating a recipe website to demonstrate
my recently aquired html skills. I will show how to set up a basic 
index or homepage and give it links to other pages on the website.
I will also include images linked from other sources on the web
as well as images from my own directory.
