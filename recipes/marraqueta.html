    <h3 class="description">Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li>8 cups flour</li>
            <li>2Â½ cups water (at room temperature)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h4 class="instructions">Instructions</h4>
    <div class="recipe">
        <ol>
            <li>In a cup put some warm water, dissolve 
            the yeast along with the sugar. Let the 
            mix rest for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, add the flour 
            and salt. Add the yeast and water mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Form a uniform and semi-soft dough. Knead 
            the dough for about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the dough into a large bowl, previously 
            sprayed with a little bit of cooking spray 
            (you can alternatively use butter instead). 
            Allow to ferment for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Then, divide the dough into portions of 
            3.5 oz (100g) each. You may use your own hand 
            to calculate and extract equally-sized portions.</li>
            <li>Wind each portion, which refers to forming 
            evenly-shaped dough balls with the palm of the hand, 
            in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>Let the dough rest again for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Join the dough balls by two portions together at a time, 
            and knead slightly to make them more elongated.</li>
            <li>Then with an accessory like a knife sharpener, 
            divide the dough in the middle, as shown in the photos.</li>
            <li>Then place the shaped pieces of dough on a baking tray lined 
            with parchment paper. Another way is to place the bread on top 
            of a buttered baking tray.</li>
            <li>Ideally, let the bread rest for another 20 minutes at least.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 18 minutes in a 450F/220C oven, or until 
            the bread is golden brown on top.</li>
        </ol>
