<h2>Marraqueta</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>8 cups flour</li>
    <li>2Â½ cups water (at room temperature)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a cup put some warm water, dissolve 
        the yeast along with the sugar. Let the 
        mix rest for 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, add the flour 
        and salt. Add the yeast and water mixture.
    </li>
    <li>Form a uniform and semi-soft dough. Knead 
        the dough for about 8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place the dough into a large bowl, previously 
        sprayed with a little bit of cooking spray 
        (you can alternatively use butter instead). 
        Allow to ferment for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Then, divide the dough into portions of 
        3.5 oz (100g) each. You may use your own hand 
        to calculate and extract equally-sized portions.</li>
    <li>Wind each portion, which refers to forming 
        evenly-shaped dough balls with the palm of the hand, 
        in a circular motion.</li>
    <li>Let the dough rest again for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Join the dough balls by two portions together at a time, 
        and knead slightly to make them more elongated.</li>
    <li>Then with an accessory like a knife sharpener, 
        divide the dough in the middle, as shown in the photos.</li>
    <li>Then place the shaped pieces of dough on a baking tray lined 
        with parchment paper. Another way is to place the bread on top 
        of a buttered baking tray.</li>
    <li>Ideally, let the bread rest for another 20 minutes at least.</li>
    <li>Bake for about 18 minutes in a 450F/220C oven, or until 
        the bread is golden brown on top.</li>
</ol>
