<h2>Nuts 4 Nuts</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tbsp water</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1½ cups raw peanuts (not roasted)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Bring the water and 1/4 cup sugar to a boil
        in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
    </li>
    <li>When the sugar has dissolved, add the nuts. Stir occasionally
        to coat the nuts. At about the 2-minute mark, stir vigorously.
        In about a minute the water will evaporate, and the sugar will 
        crystallize on the nuts. Turn off the heat immediately when all 
        of the sugar has crystallized on the nuts, but keep stirring. 
        The sugar should begin to caramelize and turn light brown on
        the nuts. Pour the nuts onto a plate to cool.
    </li>
</ol>
